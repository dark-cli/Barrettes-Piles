# Real Case Study Source

## Primary Case Study: Exim Bank Building, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

This example problem is based on a **real published case study** from the Mekong Delta, Vietnam:

## Project Details (From Published Study)

### Building Information
- **Project**: Exim Bank Building
- **Location**: Ho Chi Minh City, Mekong Delta, Vietnam
- **Building Height**: 40-story building
- **Foundation Type**: Shaft-grouted barrette piles

### Barrette Pile Specifications (From Study)
- **Cross-Section**: 2.8 m × 0.8 m (rectangular)
- **TP1 Pile Depth**: 65 m
- **TP2 Pile Depth**: 85 m
- **Construction Method**: Shaft grouting from certain depths to pile toe
- **Testing**: Bidirectional static loading tests (O-cell tests)

### Soil Profile (From Study)
The subsurface conditions consisted of:
1. **Organic Soft Clay** (top layer)
2. **Silty Sand with Gravel**
3. **Silty Clay** (deeper layers)

**Note**: The published paper contains detailed soil profiles and test results. For this example problem, the soil parameters have been adapted to be representative of typical Mekong Delta conditions while maintaining the general characteristics described in the study.

### Testing Details (From Study)
- **O-cell Assembly Location**: 16 m above pile toe level
- **Test Depth for TP1**: 49 m below pile head (65 m - 16 m)
- **Test Depth for TP2**: 69 m below pile head (85 m - 16 m)
- **Analysis**: Finite element simulations using Plaxis software

## Adaptation for Example Problem

### Simplifications Made
1. **Soil Layers**: The example problem uses a simplified 5-layer soil profile that represents typical Mekong Delta conditions, based on the general description in the paper
2. **Barrette Dimensions**: Simplified to 3.0 m × 1.5 m (standard aspect ratio) instead of 2.8 m × 0.8 m
3. **Depth**: Reduced to 30-35 m embedment (more typical for educational purposes) instead of 65-85 m
4. **Shaft Grouting**: Not included in simplified example (can be added as advanced analysis)
5. **Building Loads**: Typical loads for 35-story building (similar scale to 40-story)

### What's Real from the Study
- ✅ Project location and context
- ✅ General soil profile characteristics
- ✅ Barrette pile application (high-rise building)
- ✅ Testing methodology (O-cell tests, Plaxis analysis)
- ✅ Overall geotechnical conditions (Mekong Delta)

### What's Adapted/Simplified
- ⚠️ Specific soil parameters (based on typical values for described soil types)
- ⚠️ Exact barrette dimensions (standardized for learning)
- ⚠️ Embedment depth (reduced for simpler analysis)
- ⚠️ Detailed load values (representative of similar buildings)

## Recommendation

For a **complete real case study** with all exact parameters, you should:

1. **Access the Full Paper**: Download the Nguyen et al. (2016) paper from the link above
2. **Extract Exact Parameters**: The paper contains detailed soil profiles, test results, and design parameters
3. **Use Published Data**: Replace the simplified parameters in this example with exact values from the paper

The current example problem provides a **realistic representation** based on this published case study, but uses simplified/representative parameters for educational purposes. For research or detailed analysis, refer to the original paper for exact values.

## How to Use This Information

1. **For Learning**: The current example problem is sufficient - it's based on a real project with realistic parameters
2. **For Research**: Access the full paper and extract exact soil parameters, test results, and design details
3. **For Comparison**: Use the example problem results and compare with published test results from the paper
4. **For Extension**: Add shaft grouting effects, deeper embedment, or other complexities from the full study
