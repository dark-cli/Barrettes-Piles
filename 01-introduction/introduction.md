# Introduction to Barrettes

## Definition

Barrettes are rectangular deep foundation elements, typically constructed using diaphragm walling techniques. Unlike circular piles, barrettes have a rectangular cross-section that provides enhanced moment resistance in one direction, making them particularly suitable for applications requiring high lateral load capacity or specific directional stiffness.

## Applications

Barrettes are commonly used in:

- High-rise building foundations
- Bridge foundations and piers
- Retaining wall systems
- Structures with significant lateral loads
- Urban construction with space constraints
- Projects requiring large bearing capacity

## Advantages

1. **Directional Stiffness**: Rectangular shape provides higher moment of inertia in the strong axis
2. **Large Bearing Area**: Greater cross-sectional area compared to circular piles of equivalent width
3. **Flexibility in Design**: Various aspect ratios (length-to-width) possible
4. **Integration**: Can serve dual purpose as foundation and retaining wall element
5. **Quality Control**: Construction process allows for inspection and verification

## Limitations

1. **Construction Complexity**: More complex than circular piles due to rectangular geometry
2. **Corner Effects**: Stress concentrations at corners require careful reinforcement design
3. **Construction Methods**: Limited to certain construction techniques (diaphragm walling)
4. **Cost**: Generally more expensive than circular piles due to complexity
5. **Code Coverage**: Less standardized than circular piles in some design codes

## Overview of Analysis Approaches

The analysis of barrettes encompasses two main areas:

### Geotechnical Analysis

- Bearing capacity evaluation
- Settlement prediction
- Soil-structure interaction
- Lateral resistance and deflections

### Structural Analysis

- Axial load capacity
- Bending moment and shear forces
- Reinforcement design
- Connection details

The subsequent sections provide detailed methodologies for each aspect of barrette analysis.
